\section{Convergence Test}
Before computing the error we first need to define the $L_p$ norms for a $p > 0$ by
% notation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space#Lp_spaces
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Lp-nrom}
  \Vert f(x) \Vert = \left( \int_K \vert f(x) \vert^p d\mu  \right)^{1/p}.
\end{equation}
We start by a known analytical solution $f(x)$ and compare it to our approximation $\hat{f}(x)$.
Let $Q$ and $\hat{Q}$ denote the analytical and approximate solution at node.
We start by computing the point-wise error, and compute the cell-wise error from this.
Observe that for our broken space $\Omega$
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lp-norm-broken}
 \Vert f(x) \Vert = \sum_{K \in \Omega} \Vert f_K(x) \Vert_p.
\end{equation}

We are now ready to integrate the error for each cell.
The output contains the position and conserved variables of each point.
Each cell consists of $(N + 1)^d$ nodes, each associated with a quadrature weight $w_i$.
The quadrature weights are associated with the reference cuboid.
We thus need to map our element to the reference element, before we can compute the integral.

Let $V$ denote the volume (or area) of each cell.
For example, in three dimensions $V = \Delta x \, \Delta y \, \Delta z$.
The final result is then
\begin{equation}
  \Vert f_K(x) \Vert = \left( V \sum_{\bm{i}} \vert f(\bm{x}_{\bm{i}}) \vert^p w_{{\bm{i}}}  \right)^{1/p},
\end{equation}
where we used the mapping to the reference triangle (integration by substitution).
