\newcommand{\error}{\operatorname{Total-Error}}
Before computing the error we first need to define the $L_p$ norms for a $p > 0$ by
% notation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space#Lp_spaces
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Lp-nrom}
  \Vert f(x) \Vert_p = \left( \int_K \vert f(x) \vert^p d\mu  \right)^{1/p}.
\end{equation}
We are interested in the total error which we define as the norm of the difference between an analytical solution $f(\bm{x}, t)$ and our approximation $\hat{f}(\bm{x}, t)$.
The error at a time $t$ is thus defined as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:error}
  \error(t,p) = \Vert f(\bm{x}, t) - \hat{f}(\bm{x}, t) \Vert_p.
\end{equation}

We first observe that for our approximation space $\broken$ we can split up the error as a sum over all cells
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lp-norm-broken}
 %\Vert f(\bm{x}) \Vert = \sum_{\cell[] \in \broken} \Vert f_{\cell[]} (\bm{x}) \Vert_p,
  \error(t,p) = \sum_{\cell[] \in \broken} \error_{\cell[]}(t,p)
\end{equation}
where $\error_{\cell[]}$ is the error in the cell $\cell[]$.

\todo{Describe how to integrate the error for cells, and effect of volume}
% We are now ready to integrate the error for each cell.
% The output contains the position and conserved variables of each point.
% Each cell consists of $(N + 1)^d$ nodes, each associated with a quadrature weight $w_i$.
% The quadrature weights are associated with the reference cuboid.
% We thus need to map our element to the reference element, before we can compute the integral.

% Let $V$ denote the volume (or area) of each cell.
% For example, in two dimensions $V = \Delta x \, \Delta y$.
% The final result is then
% \begin{equation}
%   \Vert f_K(x) \Vert = \left( V \sum_{\bm{i}} \vert f(\bm{x}_{\bm{i}}) \vert^p w_{{\bm{i}}}  \right)^{1/p},
% \end{equation}
% where we used the mapping to the reference triangle (integration by substitution).

For the limiting case of $p \to \infty$ we use the maximum point-wise error.
