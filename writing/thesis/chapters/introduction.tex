\chapter{Introduction}
We make the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item We implement an \textsc{ader-dg} scheme for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations.
\item We compare different mesh refinement strategies and evaluate their computational efficiency.
\item We investigate the ability of our scheme to simulate classical fluid mechanics test scenarios correctly.
\item We describe the simulation of flows with a background state that is in hydrostatic equilibrium.
  This is useful for problems in atmospheric flow and for problems in meterology.
  Furthermore, we evaluate our discretization for these scenarios.
\end{itemize}
