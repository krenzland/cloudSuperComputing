TODO!
We made the following changes:
* Quality of numerical approximations
Reviewers wished for a quantitative analysis of our simulations for Taylor-Green and ABC-Flow scenarios.
We made clearer that this is not sensible for these scenarios, as they are not an exact solution for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations.
To address the spirit of the comments, we've added a convergence test using a manufactured solution.

* Performance
Reviewers wished for a analysis of the (parallel) performance of our code.
To keep the focus of our paper (application) we've added references to relevant papers that performed various performance studies for our code.
Furthermore, we've added a small performance study for a uniform mesh with combined MPI+TBB performance.

* Minor edits
(Editorial, etc.)
